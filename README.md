# 🧪 Urban Routes Project (Sprint 7 – QA Automation)

This is an automated testing project developed during **Sprint 7** of the TripleTen QA Engineering Bootcamp.

The goal is to structure and organize test cases using **Python** and **Pytest**, following industry best practices and preparing for future expansion using **Selenium** (Sprint 8).

---

## 🚀 Features

- Modular test structure  
- Automatic setup for test classes and methods  
- Separated test data file (`data.py`)  
- Reusable helper functions (`helpers.py`)  
- Isolated virtual environment  
- Ready for Selenium integration in Sprint 8  

---

## ▶️ How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gibran-T/urban_routes_project.git
```

2. **Install dependencies (in virtual environment):**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Run the tests:**

```bash
pytest
```

## 📚 What I Learned

- Practical use of `pytest` with structured and scalable test logic  
- Test isolation using helper and data modules  
- Preparing projects for automation with Selenium  
- Real-world automation architecture in QA projects
